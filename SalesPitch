Agentic AI — Commercial Real Estate Due-Diligence Agent

Problem

Manual commercial real-estate due diligence is slow, error-prone, and expensive. Analysts stitch together public records, proprietary feeds, lease documents, financial statements and third‑party reports — resulting in inconsistent conclusions, missed risks, and long deal cycles.

Solution

Agentic AI automates and standardizes commercial property due diligence by ingesting multi-source data, creating a canonical property record, surfacing provenance for every claim, and producing structured reports and risk scores. It combines data engineering, SQL-backed provenance, and LLM-powered analysis to deliver repeatable, auditable diligence at scale.

Key benefits

- Speed: reduce time-to-insight from days to hours by automating ingestion, normalization, and initial analysis.
- Accuracy & auditability: every derived data point links back to raw sources with confidence metrics and timestamps, enabling defensible decisions.
- Cost efficiency: reduce analyst hours and accelerate deal throughput.
- Consistency: standardized schemas, migrations and agent workflows produce repeatable outputs across portfolios.

Core features (MVP)

- Canonical property model (address, identifiers, financials, leases, docs)
- Multi-source ingest and source-id upserts
- Provenance tracking (field-level source, confidence, raw payload)
- Structured report generation with confidence scoring
- Lightweight web dashboard for search, provenance inspection, and property review
- Alembic-powered migrations, Postgres-backed storage, FastAPI endpoints for integrations

Technology

- FastAPI + Uvicorn for the API
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic for data modeling & migrations
- Postgres (pgcrypto, citext, pg_trgm) for robust storage and search
- Docker + docker-compose for local dev and reproducible environments
- Minimal web UI for analysts to review properties, provenance and reports

Target customers

- CRE investors and asset managers performing portfolio-level underwriting
- Due-diligence teams at brokerages and advisory firms
- Lenders and RE debt underwriters seeking faster, auditable credit reviews

Go-to-market & monetization

- Pilot engagements with mid-sized asset managers (SaaS + professional services integration)
- Tiered subscription per-asset or per-seat, with premium features for automated agent workflows and priority support
- Data partnerships / paid connectors for premium property and lease data

Next milestones

1. Harden migrations and production deployment (Dockerfile, web service, CI)
2. Add connectors for key CRE data sources and secure credentials management
3. Expand report types and automated agent workflows for targeted underwriting tasks
4. Pilot with 2–3 customers and iterate UX and report output based on feedback
